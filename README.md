`Primal OS` is a multi-purpose cross-platform operating system developed by Tabib Hakir. It is the first full-scene distributed OS based on microkernel. It is an operating system independently developed by Tabib Hakir. `Primal OS` System will officially be released when the project is fully set. Tabib Hakir will take the lead in deploying intelligent terminals such as smart screens, artificial intelligence and wearable terminals. In the future, more smart devices will be equipped with open source `Primal OS` than ever.
